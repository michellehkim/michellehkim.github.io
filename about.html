          <p class= "main-1"> My curiosity has led me to many exciting places. My journey begins with a wooden box filled with colored pencils, markers and crayons.
            At the age of 5, the sight of neatly-lined colors brought me so much joy.
            The idea that I could bring to life anything I imagined through colors gave me a strong sense of freedom.
            My love for art continued throughout my childhood and into my teenage years, where I began exploring different mediums such as paint, photography and ceramics. </p>
          <p class= "main-2">In college, my interests in culture and human behavior overshadowed my love for art. I focused my studies on international studies and spent a year studying politics and psychology in Barcelona. After graduating from UCSB, I relocated to South Korea, where I worked both independently and in a collaborative environment teaching English. I backpacked throughout Southeast Asia for 3 months before returning home to California. My experience backpacking reconnected me with my creative side, when I began to see art not only as a form of expression but as creativity in alignment with purpose. I saw how good design positively affects others and brings people together.
</p>
          <p class= "main-3">Still driven by curiosity, I aim to bring people together by solving digital problems. My goal is to understand the space where humans and technology interact, crossing functionality and visual design. By keeping humans at the center of my design process, curiosity and empathy become core values that help guide me through my design process.
