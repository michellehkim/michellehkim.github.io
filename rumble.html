        <p data-aos="fade-up">Although Google Maps or Yelp can be used to search for restaurants, browsing through dozens of places can be time consuming and lead to greater indecision.
          An app that saves time would add great value for the average hungry human. </p>
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" class= "titles">THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">Rumble generates a list of restaurants and randomly chooses where the user should dine out.
          They can set their location and filter through food types, price point and other filter options.
          This decision making app creates an intuitive and personalized experience while helping local restaurants and saving users from indecision.</p>

        <h3 class= "titles">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
        <p>I looked into three existing apps and conducted a SWOT analysis to compare features and understand strengths and weaknesses across these platforms.
          <b>Yelp</b> was most widely used by participants to find restaurants.
          It is used to find businesses outside of just restaurants and has advanced search capabilities with various filters.
          It has a strong review system but is criticized for having unreliable reviews. <b>Spotluck</b> and <b>Restaurant Roulette</b> also help find restaurants but are closer to a decision-making application.
          Spotluck soley focuses on discounts but with a limited pool or restaurants, users aren’t always satisfied with restaurants that are chosen.
          Restuarant Roulette includes filters for cuisine, price and location, but there are no other features and users must set all filters in order for the app to choose a restaurant.

            Roboto, also a modern sans serif, was used as the secondary font. It is not as rounded as it’s pairing font, but instead has a more formal personality, effectively contrasting with the playful nature of Poppins.
            Pairing these two recognizably different fonts together create a modern feel that is dynamic and easy to digest. I used letter spacing to my advantage to create a spacious look.

          The onboarding process along with adding their own restaurants into a list were completed with ease.
          Users experienced some trouble when asked to find a list of restaurants by setting filters and leaving a review.
          The directions given along with the how the information was organized led to confusion.
          Through testing, I was able to see where I needed to make changes to simplfy these tasks.

      <div class= "wireframe-text">
        <p data-aos="fade-up"><b>Home Page:</b> I created three separate options to get a list of restuarants: a filtered list, a list of your own restaurants and a list of discounted restaurants.
          I decided to include a discount option on the homepage since the majority of participants said they were influenced by discounts.
          Through testing, I discovered that there was not enough information to clarify what each selection would yield.
          Having three differing options also caused confusion. To simplify the tasks, I eliminated the discount option and merged it with the filtered list option and added text to add more clairty and simplify the page.

          I created different versions, creating preference tests and seeing which screens worked best.
          In testing, users found the information to look too cluttered on one page. I decided to space each filter option onto separate screens, highlighting each selection.
          This change also led to a different approach in presenting the information. Instead of separating each filter section with a label, questions were presented to engage the user in conversation and humanize the app.</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">In the high fidelity mockups, I wanted to create a strong structural hierarchy via text size, color, and spacing while focusing on engagement and consistency.
          Another round of testing was done to test out changes made from the wireframes.</p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up"><b>Hierarchy and Clarity: </b><br>
            A screen was added before onboarding to give clarity and explain the decision making app.
            On the onboarding screens and homepage, anchor texts were kept consistent and a dark background was used to highlight call-to-actions.
            I also deemphasized secondary buttons or kept buttons dormant to give focus to the primary actions.
            Lastly, I played around with font styles and size to emphasize visual hierarchy.</p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up"><b>Filter Page:</b><br>
              After wireframe testing, I distributed the filter options into separate screens, but realized its weak usability.
              Users had no way of quickly viewing their filtered options so I reverted back to including all filters on one page, but omitting ‘distance from location’ and ‘discounts and offers only’.
              The ‘distance from location’ was removed since the app automatically finds restaurants near the location selected and a discount option was included under ‘More options’ instead of having its own section.
              These changes proved to be helpful, with users experiencing little to no difficulty during testing. By choosing to get rid of these sections, more space was created to evenly display information onto a single screen and provide greater visibility.</p>

              </div>
                <p data-aos="fade-up">I made different versions of the filter screen such as including images to break up the text.
                  The images worked on a smaller scale, but when added to all options, it gave a cluttered look.
                  I found that setting all filter selections to equal widths without images gave a clean look that was easy to read.</p>

                  When asked to leave a review, some users were unsure of where to start.
                  It either created initial confusion or took some time to complete.
                  For greater visibility, I included a ‘History’ icon in the bottom nav where users could quickly view selected restaurants from the past, taking them directly to the restaurant page where they could leave a review.
                  WHen retested, all participants were able to quickly leave a review.</p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up"><b>Take decisive action and keep moving forward.</b><br>
            I found that feedback is crucial and needed in moving on and making better design decisions, but spending too much time on certain aspects would keep me from moving on to the next step.
            I needed to keep looking forward and take action by setting a time limit for each phase. </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up"><br><b>The more testing the better.</b><br>
              More testing during the intial stages could have prevented me from building out detailed screens that were not needed, saving me time.
              Although conducting more tests earlier on is helpful, I learned that there is no linear design process and some steps can be done more than once.</p>
