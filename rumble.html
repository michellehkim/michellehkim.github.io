With different preferences and personalities, making a quick decision that satisfies everyones needs seems nearly impossible. Rumble is here to ease the process by answering the old age question of, “What do you want to eat?” by randomly choosing a restaurant for you.

        <h3 class= "titles">THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to help hungry humans get rid of the time spent deciding where to eat. Users filter through restaurants and Rumble chooses a destination for them. The application creates an intuitive, descriptive and personalized decision making app that can be used daily, helping local restaurants and saving the “Ummm”’s, “Whatever”’s and “I don’t know,”s for another day.

            I chose to use a bright color like orange that stimluates the mind and grabs your attention.
            Bright colors such as red and orange are also connected to appetite and stimulation.
            Choosing to focus on one color made for strong brand recognition.
            Deep navy blue and grey were used as secondary colors to give depth to the primary orange color, creating a bold and dynamic look.</p>

        <p> Poppins, a geometric sans serif, was used as the primary font. The symmetrical curavtures create a modern look with text that is evenly spaced and easy to read.
            Roboto, also a modern sans serif, was used as the secondary font. It is not as rounded as it’s pairing font, but instead has a more formal personality, effectively contrasting with the playful nature of Poppins.
            Pairing these two recognizably different fonts together create a modern feel that is dynamic and easy to digest. I used letter spacing to my advantage, creating a spacious look.

        <p>Taking the user flows, I quickly sketched a basic layout for each screen on paper. I then used Figma to create a set of wireframes and tested them on a few participants via Marvel and Figma. The onboarding process along with adding their own restaurants into a list were completed with ease. Users experienced some trouble when asked to find a list of restaurants by setting filters and leaving a review. The directions given along with the how the information was organized led to confusion. Through testing, I was able to see where I needed to make changes to simplfy these tasks.

        <p><b>Home screen:</b> I created three separate shuffles to get a list of restuarants: a filtered spin, adding your own restaurants and a discount option.
          I included a discount option on the homepage since the majority of participants look for discounts when deciding where to eat.
          Through testing, I discovered that including a discount spin on the home page created confusion, so I eliminated the discount button and merged it as a filtered option.
        </p>
        <p><b>Filtered spin:</b> The filtered page consists of five sections that include setting a location, the distance from location, food types, discounts and other options. In testing, users found the information to look too cluttered. Initially all on one screen, I spaced them out into separate screens, highlighting each filter and giving the information room. This change also led to a different approach in presenting the information. Instead of separating each filter section with a    label, questions were presented to engage them in a conversation and humanize the app.</p>
        <p><b>Call-to-action buttons:</b> For the on boarding screens, I deemphasized secondary buttons, giving attention to the primary call to action buttons.
        <b>Location access:</b> I made sure to ask for access to the user’s location after they clicked an action to set a location, rather than asking at the start when the user is not aware of the app’s capabilities.

        <p>In the high fidelity mockups, I aimed to create a strong structural hierarchy via text size, color and spacing while focusing on engagement and consistency.
          Another round of testing was done to test out changes made from the wireframes.</p

      <p><b>Hierarchy and Clarity: </b><br>
        A screen was added before onboarding to explaining the decision making app and clarify that it was not just another Yelp app. On the onboarding screens and homepage, Anchor texts were kept consistent and dark background was used to highlight call-to-actions. I also deemphasized secondary buttons or buttons that should not yet be used to narrow down the focus to primary actions.
        For visual hierarchy, I incorporated all caps for buttons and played around with caps and font size for subtitles.
        </p>
        <!-- include home screen and sign up page. (to show hierarchy of CTAs       -->
        <p><b>Filter Page:</b><br>
          I made different versions of the filter screen, such as incorporating visuals to break up the text.
          I ultimately left the image out of the filters and instead created each button to be of equal widths to give greater consistency and readability.
            For selected filter options, I used a different color outside of orange to highlight a selected filter as not to overwhelm the page with a single color.
        </p>
<!-- **filter page with selected fitlers (hifi) & wireframes of words at all different widths
**include hifi of filter page with food type images (rough draft and final)   -->
          <p>After wireframe testing, I distributed the filter options into separate screens, but realized its weak usability.
            Users had no way of quickly viewing their filtered options so I reverted back to including all filters on one page, and omitting the ‘distance from location’ and ‘discounts and offers only’ sections.
            The ‘distance from location’ was removed since the app automatically finds restaurants near the location selected. The discount section was also excluded and a separate discount option under ‘More options’ was included instead.
            DUring testing, users were able to find the discount filter with little trouble. By choosing to get rid of these two sections, more space was created to evenly display information onto a single screen without creating clutter.
            Users are now able to view all selected filters on one screen, creating greater visibility. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p><b>Leaving a Review:</b><br>
            When asked to leave a review, some users were unsure of where to start.
            For those who were able to successfully submit a review, it either created some initial confusion or took more time to complete.
            For greater visibility, I included a ‘History’ icon in the bottom nav where users could quickly view selected restaurants from the past, taking them directly to the restuarant page where they could leave a review.</p>

          <p><b>Building for the user.</b><br>
            Keeping my users in mind throughout the process from conception to finalization allowed me to stay focused on creating a product that an actual user might find valuable. Things that seem clear to me might not be clear for the user. Making changes based on the needs of the actual user instead of relying on my own preferences or assumptions was essential.</p>
            <p><br><b>User testing and iteration.</b><br>
            User testing was invaluable in finalizing the application.
            Most of the changes happened during this step, emphasizing the importance of research and testing in the early phases.
            With that being said, presenting the user tests by giving clear and specific directions was important in minimizing confusion.
            Constant testing and iteration was key!
            If given more time, I would have tested more users in both the survey and first usablility test to gather a larger set of data, since most participants were students or within the same field of work.</p>
