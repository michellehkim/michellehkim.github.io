        <p class= "overview-text">Deciding where to eat sounds easy, but it can be a daunting task. With different preferences and personalities, making a quick decision that satisfies everyones needs seems nearly impossible. Rumble is here to ease the process by answering the old age question of, “What do you want to eat?” by randomly choosing a restaurant for you.

        <h3 class= "titles">THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to help hungry humans get rid of the time spent deciding where to eat. Users filter through restaurants and Rumble chooses a destination for them. The application creates an intuitive, descriptive and personalized decision making app that can be used daily, helping local restaurants and saving the “Ummm”’s, “Whatever”’s and “I don’t know,”s for another day.

          contained space with an endless realm of possiblity, the perfect space
          to store ideas. The geometric shapes within the cloud symbolize

        <p>I started by sketching out a basic framework for both mobile an desktop versions that included screens for each user flow. I then used Balsamiq to create low fidelity wireframes, adding more detail and different variations of the dashboard.
          In creating my prototypes, I realized some steps that were overlooked. For example, there was a screen missing letting the user know when they had completed a task and no way for participants to go back to a screen. Constant iterations were made to keep both desktop and mobile versions consistent.

Overall, the sign up process was smooth for all three participants. Due to the simplicity of the wireframes, some found it tricky differentiating between headers and action buttons in the mobile version when uploading a file. Another participant had trouble identifying the files on the desktop.</p>

        <p>Assesing the feedback recieved from participants and implementing the branding elements, I created a set of hi- fidelity mockups while focusing on alignment and overall consistency. I conducted a second usability test to work out any kinks and a quick preference test on Usability Hub was conducted to test out preferred designs and solidify my choices. </p>

        <p>Testing was done through clickable prototypes using inVision. Overall, participants were comfortable through each step and was able to complete most tasks with minor issues. The added detail, from text, color choice and font size made for greater legibility and contributed to smoother process. Suggestions to change one action button into four separate icons was implementing into the final design, minimizing the amount of clicks for the user. </p>

          <p><b>Building for the user.</b><br>
            Keeping my users in mind throughout the process from conception to finalization allowed me to stay focused on creating a product that an actual user might find valuable. Things that seem clear to me might not be clear for the user. Making changes based on the needs of the actual user instead of relying on my own preferences or assumptions was essential.</p>
            <p><br><b>User testing and iteration.</b><br>
            User testing was invaluable in finalizing the application.
            Most of the changes happened during this step, emphasizing the importance of research and testing in the early phases.
            With that being said, presenting the user tests by giving clear and specific directions was important in minimizing confusion.
            Constant testing and iteration was key!
            If given more time, I would have tested more users in both the survey and first usablility test to gather a larger set of data, since most participants were students or within the same field of work.</p>
