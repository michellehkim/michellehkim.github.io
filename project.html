        <h3>THE PROBLEMS</h3>
      </div>
        <p>There are many cloud storage applications currently out on the market, but
           many possess cluttered dashboards, weak search capabilities and a lack of
           storage capacity. This can make it difficult and confusing to navigate
           throughout the app and find content. Cloudrop aims to minimize these
           frustrations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution">

        <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Cloudrop provides an intuitive experience through its simplistic layout and
           friendly colors, along with simple content management. Through an
           extensive process including user research, competitive analysis, and user
           testing, Cloudrop was created. This service allows users to easily categorize
           and locate content, upload and save files, and collaborate on files with others.</p>

        <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>I wanted to get to know my target audience and existing cloud applications
            were being used. My main focus was to understand what features users
            value along with frustrations and inconsistencies in these current
            applications.</p>

            <button type= "button"><a href="project.html">view case study</a>
            </button>

        <h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
          <p>100% use an online save & share service.</p>
          <p>44% value the ability to share and real time collaboration.</p>
          <p>67% use a laptop.</p>
          <p>50% value easy organization of files and given storage space.</p>
          <p>73% share or collaborate on files.</p>

        <h3>OVERALL</h3>
          <p>I found that the majority of respondents value sharing and collaborating content
            quickly. They also look for clear organization of files and the ability to locate their
            content with ease. From the survey results, I interviewed two different users to
            discover their motivations, goals and frustrations, resulting in two distinct personas.</p>

      <!--competitive analysis-->
      <div class= "competitive analysis">

        <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>With a number of existing cloud services available, I took a closer look into
            three big competitors to better understand the market place and review the
            strengths and weaknesses of these applications. All offer functions to save,
            organize and share content. I focused on existing features and key
            differentiators in order to seek out opportunities where I could add the
            most value for the user.</p>

              outside of school, using both her laptop
              and mobile device to share documents.
              She values how easily accessible her files
              are from her cloud storage. She likes to
              organize and separate her files so she can
              share personal photos with friends and
              keep her school files for projects.</p>

            <h3>BRANDING STORY & LOGO</h3>
            <p>When starting to conceptualize a brand identity, I focused on the idea
              of space and safety. For the logo, I went through many iterations and
              ultimately chose a cloud to represent the platform. It symbolizes a self-
              contained space with an endless realm of possiblity, the perfect space
              to store ideas. The geometric shapes within the cloud symbolize
              digitized security within the platform.</p>

          <div class= "branding images">
            <div class= "branding-image-1">
              <img src= "logo_sketch_1.png">

              <img src= "digital_sketch.png">
            </div>

              <p>Mindmaps and word association was used to create a name that was simple and
                catchy. I settled on Cloudrop due to its simple and easy nature, with â€˜dropâ€™
                describing something being done with ease. Using Sketch and Adobe Illustrator, I
                digitized the sketches and created different versions playing around with triangle
                size, borders and colors.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="colors">
            <h3>COLORS</h3>
          <div class="primary-colors">
            <img src="blue_1.png">
            <p>#0E5275</p>

            <p>#489EB4</p>
          </div>

          <p>The brand logo is composed of three primary shades of blue.
            The deep blue shade represents trust and security while the brighter blue embodies creativitiy.</p>

          <div class= "secondary-colors">

            <p>#F8F8F8</p>
          </div>

          <p>The secondary colors consists of shades of grey, a light blue and a soft orange. The soft orange has a warming effect, stimulating mental activity.</p>

          <p>The branding is refined and modern, yet portrays a social and fun aspect through the use of color that appeals for both professional and social use.</p>

          <h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
          <img src="typography.png">
          <p>I used Liber Grotesque primarily for the headlines. Its rounded and harmonious structure represents the secure elements of the brand. I paired the sans serif font with Heebo, a humanist san serif that is modern yet approachable and easy to read.</p>

          <div class="wireframes">
            <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
            <p>I started by sketching out a basic framework for both mobile an desktop versions that included screens for each user flow. I then used Balsamiq to create low fidelity wireframes, adding more detail and different variations of the dashboard.
            In creating my prototypes, I realized some steps that were overlooked. For example, there was a screen missing letting the user know when they had completed a task and no way for participants to go back to a screen. Constant iterations were made to keep both desktop and mobile versions consistent.
            </p>
            <img src= "desktop_wireframes.png">
            <p>I worked with three participants in person to test a few actions. I tested the process of signing up for an account, uploading and sharing a file, and organizing files into a folder. Overall, the sign up process was smooth for all three participants. Due to the simplicity of the wireframes, some found it tricky differentiating between headers and action buttons in the mobile version when uploading a file. Another participant had trouble identifying the files on the desktop.</p>

            <h3>HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUPS</h3>
            <p>Assesing the feedback recieved from participants and implementing the branding elements, I created a set of hi- fidelity mockups while focusing on alignment and overall consistency. I conducted a second usability test to work out any kinks and a quick preference test on Usability Hub was conducted to test out preferred designs and solidify my choices. </p>

            <h3>TESTING</h3>
              <p>Testing was done through clickable prototypes using inVision. Overall, participants were comfortable through each step and was able to complete most tasks with minor issues. The added detail, from text, color choice and font size made for greater legibility and contributed to smoother process. Suggestions to change one action button into four separate icons was implementing into the final design, minimizing the amount of clicks for the user. </p>

              <p>Three separate preference tests were also conducted to improve visual design. Tests revolved around the color of the side bar on the dashboard, the color of pop up messages in the mobile version, and button shape.

            <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
            <p>Building for the user.
              Keeping my users in mind throughout the process from conception to finalization allowed me to stay focused on creating a product that an actual user might find valuable. Things that seem clear to me might not be clear for the user. Making changes based on the needs of the actual user instead of relying on my own preferences or assumptions was essential.

              User testing and iteration.
              User testing was invaluable in finalizing the application. Most of the changes happened during this step, emphasizing the importance of research and testing in the early phases. With that being said, presenting the user tests by giving clear and specific directions was important in minimizing confusion. Constant testing and iteration was key!</p>

              If given more time, I would have tested more users in both the survey and first usablility test to gather a larger set of data, since most participants were students or within the same field of work.
