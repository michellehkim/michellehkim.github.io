    <h3 class= "problem-solution-title">THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>There are many cloud storage applications currently out on the market, but
       many possess cluttered dashboards, weak search capabilities and a lack of
       storage capacity. This can make it difficult and confusing to navigate
       throughout the app and find content. Cloudrop aims to minimize these
       frustrations.</p>
    <h3 class="problem-solution-title">THE SOLUTION</h3>
    <p>Cloudrop provides an intuitive experience through its simplistic layout and
       friendly colors, along with simple content management. Through an
       extensive process including user research, competitive analysis, and user
       testing, Cloudrop was created. This service allows users to easily categorize
       and locate content, upload and save files, and collaborate on files with others.</p>

    <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
    <p>I wanted to get to know my target audience and existing cloud applications
        were being used. My main focus was to understand what features users
        value along with frustrations and inconsistencies in these current
        applications.</p>

    <h3>OVERALL</h3>
      <p>I found that the majority of respondents value sharing and collaborating content
        quickly. They also look for clear organization of files and the ability to locate their
        content with ease. From the survey results, I interviewed two different users to
        discover their motivations, goals and frustrations, resulting in two distinct personas.</p>

  <div class= "competitive-analysis">
    <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
    <p>With a number of existing cloud services available, I took a closer look into
      three big competitors to better understand the market place and review the
      strengths and weaknesses of these applications. All offer functions to save,
      organize and share content. I focused on existing features and key
      differentiators in order to seek out opportunities where I could add the
      most value for the user.</p>

        <p>Jenn works on school projects in and
          outside of school, using both her laptop
          and mobile device to share documents.
          She values how easily accessible her files
          are from her cloud storage. She likes to
          organize and separate her files so she can
          share personal photos with friends and
          keep her school files for projects.</p>

          on multiple projects at once. She is
          typically conducting research and
          collecting data, so collaborating and
          sharing her findings are an important. She
          must synthesize her findings into large
          documents and create presentations for
          clients, creating various files such as
          documents, slides, and spreadsheets. She
          relies on quick accessbility and easy

  <div class="story-logo">
      <h3>BRANDING STORY & LOGO</h3>
      <p>When starting to conceptualize a brand identity, I focused on the idea
        of space and safety. For the logo, I went through many iterations and
        ultimately chose a cloud to represent the platform. It symbolizes a self-
        contained space with an endless realm of possiblity, the perfect space
        to store ideas. The geometric shapes within the cloud symbolize
        digitized security within the platform.</p>

      <p>Mindmaps and word association was used to create a name that was simple and
          catchy. <br>
          I settled on Cloudrop due to its simple and easy nature, with ‘drop’
          describing something being done with ease. Using Sketch and Adobe Illustrator, I
          digitized the sketches and created different versions playing around with triangle
          size, borders and colors.</p>

<!--Wireframes and Testing-->
<section class="wireframes-testing">
  <h2>WIREFRAMES & TESTING</h2>
  <div class="wireframes">
    <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
    <p>I started by sketching out a basic framework for both mobile an desktop versions that included screens for each user flow. I then used Balsamiq to create low fidelity wireframes, adding more detail and different variations of the dashboard.
      In creating my prototypes, I realized some steps that were overlooked. For example, there was a screen missing letting the user know when they had completed a task and no way for participants to go back to a screen. Constant iterations were made to keep both desktop and mobile versions consistent.
    </p>
    <img src= "desktop_wireframes.png" alt="desktop wireframes">
    <p>I worked with three participants in person to test a few actions. I tested the process of signing up for an account, uploading and sharing a file, and organizing files into a folder. Overall, the sign up process was smooth for all three participants. Due to the simplicity of the wireframes, some found it tricky differentiating between headers and action buttons in the mobile version when uploading a file. Another participant had trouble identifying the files on the desktop.</p>

  <div class= "hifi-mockups">
    <h3>HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUPS</h3>
    <p>Assesing the feedback recieved from participants and implementing the branding elements, I created a set of hi- fidelity mockups while focusing on alignment and overall consistency. I conducted a second usability test to work out any kinks and a quick preference test on Usability Hub was conducted to test out preferred designs and solidify my choices. </p>

      <h3>TESTING</h3>
      <p>Testing was done through clickable prototypes using inVision. Overall, participants were comfortable through each step and was able to complete most tasks with minor issues. The added detail, from text, color choice and font size made for greater legibility and contributed to smoother process. Suggestions to change one action button into four separate icons was implementing into the final design, minimizing the amount of clicks for the user. </p>
        <div class= "prototype-buttons">

      <p>Three separate preference tests were also conducted to improve visual design. Tests revolved around the color of the side bar on the dashboard, the color of pop up messages in the mobile version, and button shape.

  <h2>INSIGHTS</h2>
  <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
  <p>Building for the user.
    Keeping my users in mind throughout the process from conception to finalization allowed me to stay focused on creating a product that an actual user might find valuable. Things that seem clear to me might not be clear for the user. Making changes based on the needs of the actual user instead of relying on my own preferences or assumptions was essential.
    User testing and iteration.
    User testing was invaluable in finalizing the application. Most of the changes happened during this step, emphasizing the importance of research and testing in the early phases. With that being said, presenting the user tests by giving clear and specific directions was important in minimizing confusion. Constant testing and iteration was key!
    If given more time, I would have tested more users in both the survey and first usablility test to gather a larger set of data, since most participants were students or within the same field of work.</p>
