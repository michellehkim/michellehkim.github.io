        <h3>THE PROBLEMS</h3>
      </div>
        <p>There are many cloud storage applications currently out on the market, but
           many possess cluttered dashboards, weak search capabilities and a lack of
           storage capacity. This can make it difficult and confusing to navigate
           throughout the app and find content. Cloudrop aims to minimize these
           frustrations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution">

        <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Cloudrop provides an intuitive experience through its simplistic layout and
           friendly colors, along with simple content management. Through an
           extensive process including user research, competitive analysis, and user
           testing, Cloudrop was created. This service allows users to easily categorize
           and locate content, upload and save files, and collaborate on files with others.</p>

        <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>I wanted to get to know my target audience and existing cloud applications
            were being used. My main focus was to understand what features users
            value along with frustrations and inconsistencies in these current
            applications.</p>

            <button type= "button"><a href="project.html">view case study</a>
            </button>

        <h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
          <p>100% use an online save & share service.</p>
          <p>44% value the ability to share and real time collaboration.</p>
          <p>67% use a laptop.</p>
          <p>50% value easy organization of files and given storage space.</p>
          <p>73% share or collaborate on files.</p>

        <h3>OVERALL</h3>
          <p>I found that the majority of respondents value sharing and collaborating content
            quickly. They also look for clear organization of files and the ability to locate their
            content with ease. From the survey results, I interviewed two different users to
            discover their motivations, goals and frustrations, resulting in two distinct personas.</p>

      <!--competitive analysis-->
      <div class= "competitive analysis">

        <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>With a number of existing cloud services available, I took a closer look into
            three big competitors to better understand the market place and review the
            strengths and weaknesses of these applications. All offer functions to save,
            organize and share content. I focused on existing features and key
            differentiators in order to seek out opportunities where I could add the
            most value for the user.</p>

                user.</p>

          <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
            <p>Jenn works on school projects in and
              outside of school, using both her laptop
              and mobile device to share documents.
              She values how easily accessible her files
              are from her cloud storage. She likes to
              organize and separate her files so she can
              share personal photos with friends and
              keep her school files for projects.</p>
          <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p>- Files safe and secure in cloud storage
                - Locate all files quickly and efficiently
                - Aptly organizing saved content</p>
          <h3>FRUSTRATIONS</h3>
            <p>- Has to check both school and social accounts separately
                - Some plans are too expensive</p>

          <h4>Market Research Analyst</h4>
          <p>Age: 32/ Location: Los Angeles, CA/Gender: Female</p>

          <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
            <p>As a Market Research Analyst, Kate works
              on multiple projects at once. She is
              typically conducting research and
              collecting data, so collaborating and
              sharing her findings are an important. She
              must synthesize her findings into large
              documents and create presentations for
              clients, creating various files such as
              documents, slides, and spreadsheets. She
              relies on quick accessbility and easy
              organization of files in order to
              successfully complete tasks and projects.</p>

          <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p> - Organization with a clear hierarchy
                - Easily collaborate on documents
                - Easier ways to share and collaborate files</p>

          <h3>FRUSTRATIONS</h3>
            <p> - Unable to clearly differentiate between files
                - Limited storage space
                - Too much time spent finding different types of files in storage</p>

            create a dasboard with a clear hierarchy

            the onboarding process to sharing a file.
            A <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fylw876-sQqnyMZ1iIyeWFmChtDPMIDu/view?usp=sharing">site map</a> was also created, combining
            my user flows and bringing clarity to the

            <h3>BRANDING STORY & LOGO</h3>
            <p>When starting to conceptualize a brand identity, I focused on the idea
              of space and safety. For the logo, I went through many iterations and
              ultimately chose a cloud to represent the platform. It symbolizes a self-
              contained space with an endless realm of possiblity, the perfect space
              to store ideas. The geometric shapes within the cloud symbolize
              digitized security within the platform.</p>

          <div class= "branding images">
            <div class= "branding-image-1">

              <img src= "digital_sketch.png">
            </div>
              <p>Mindmaps and word association was used to create a name that was simple and
                catchy. I settled on Cloudrop due to its simple and easy nature, with â€˜dropâ€™
                describing something being done with ease. Using Sketch and Adobe Illustrator, I
                digitized the sketches and created different versions playing around with triangle
                size, borders and colors.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="colors">
            <h3>COLORS</h3>
          <div class="primary-colors">
            <img src="blue_1.png">
            <p>#0E5275</p>

            <p>#248199</p>
            <img src="blue_3.png">
            <p>#489EB4</p>
          </div>

          <p>The brand logo is composed of three primary shades of blue.
            The deep blue shade represents trust and security while the brighter blue embodies creativitiy.</p>

          <div class= "secondary-colors">

            <img src= "grey_2.png">
            <p>#F8F8F8</p>
          </div>

          <p>The secondary colors consists of shades of grey, a light blue and a soft orange. The soft orange has a warming effect, stimulating mental activity.</p>

          <p>The branding is refined and modern, yet portrays a social and fun aspect through the use of color that appeals for both professional and social use.</p>
