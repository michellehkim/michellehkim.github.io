            She values how easily accessible her files
            are from her cloud storage. She likes to
            organize and separate her files so she can

            must synthesize her findings into large
            documents and create presentations for
            clients, creating various files such as
            documents, slides, and spreadsheets. She

      <p class= "info">When starting to conceptualize a brand identity, I focused on the idea
        of space and safety. For the logo, I went through many iterations and
        ultimately chose a cloud to represent the platform. It symbolizes a self-
        contained space with an endless realm of possiblity, the perfect space
        to store ideas. The geometric shapes within the cloud symbolize
        digitized security within the platform.</p>

          I settled on Cloudrop due to its simple and easy nature, with â€˜dropâ€™

    <p class= "info">I started by sketching out a basic framework for both mobile an desktop versions that included screens for each user flow. I then used Balsamiq to create low fidelity wireframes, adding more detail and different variations of the dashboard.
      In creating my prototypes, I realized some steps that were overlooked. For example, there was a screen missing letting the user know when they had completed a task and no way for participants to go back to a screen. Constant iterations were made to keep both desktop and mobile versions consistent.

    <div class= "desktop-sketch">

    <p class= "wireframes-p2">I worked with three participants in person to test a few actions. I tested the process of signing up for an account, uploading and sharing a file, and organizing files into a folder. Overall, the sign up process was smooth for all three participants. Due to the simplicity of the wireframes, some found it tricky differentiating between headers and action buttons in the mobile version when uploading a file. Another participant had trouble identifying the files on the desktop.</p>

    <div class= "insight-paragraphs">
    <p class= "insight-info"><b>Building for the user.</b><br>
      Keeping my users in mind throughout the process from conception to finalization allowed me to stay focused on creating a product that an actual user might find valuable. Things that seem clear to me might not be clear for the user. Making changes based on the needs of the actual user instead of relying on my own preferences or assumptions was essential.</p>
      <p class= "insight-info"><br><b>User testing and iteration.</b><br>
      User testing was invaluable in finalizing the application. Most of the changes happened during this step, emphasizing the importance of research and testing in the early phases. With that being said, presenting the user tests by giving clear and specific directions was important in minimizing confusion. Constant testing and iteration was key!
      If given more time, I would have tested more users in both the survey and first usablility test to gather a larger set of data, since most participants were students or within the same field of work.</p>
